***Hi everyone! This platform is meant to create for supply chain department for easier management and analysis***

I am creating this because the current company I am working under having difficulty in requesting items (They often use Whatsapp which potentially miss the order sometimes ) from warehouse, and often my colleague in warehouse don't know the quantities left in warehouse to be issued out

This platform is suitable for: </br>
***1. Business which often have user need to request items from warehouse/store*** <br />
***2. Supply Chain Department which need to track how much items left inhouse*** <br />
***3. Want to analyse the trend of outbound item quantities*** <br />

Functions available: </br>
***1. Add your warehouse items info with name, quantities, notifications*** <br />
***2. Users to request items from warehouse, supply chain incharge person to fulfill or postpone the request*** <br />
***3. Auto decrease available quantity after fulfilling request*** <br />
***4. Graph representation on outbound trend statistics*** <br />
***5. Table view of inhouse items, easy and simple to manage*** <br />
